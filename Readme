Description:
A database to store user profile and order information. Session support so that users may log in, place orders, and view a history of their orders. Users will also have the option of setting their own profile to private/public, which will limit who can view their order history. Uses MongoDB to store the user profile, order data, and session data. Used Mongoose for database manipulation within Node.js.

Instructions:
- To install all dependencies
	npm install
- To initialize database
	run your mongodb daemon
	node database-initializer.js
- To run server
	node server.js

Design Decisions:
- I decided to use a folder to hold restaurant information, instead in client/server files, 
so that there would be less code to go through
- The database-initializer.js file was modified to include and order property that holds an array of order objects
so that I could include them in the users page
