Instructions:
- To install all dependencies
	npm install
- To initialize database
	run your mongodb daemon
	node database-initializer.js
- To run server
	node server.js

Design Decisions:
- I decided to use a folder to hold restaurant information, instead in client/server files, 
so that there would be less code to go through
- The database-initializer.js file was modified to include and order property that holds an array of order objects
so that I could include them in the users page
